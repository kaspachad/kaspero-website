  <div class="opening-section">
    <p>Crypto was supposed to change the world.</p>
    <p>It was supposed to replace money — not build <strong>bridges back to fiat</strong>.</p>
    <p>It was supposed to create a new economic layer — not become a <strong>casino</strong> where speculation masquerades as innovation.</p>
    <p class="highlight-text">We can still build that future. But it means asking a harder question: <strong>who are we building for?</strong></p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Where We Are</h2>
    <p>Look around the crypto space and you'll see brilliant minds solving fascinating problems:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cross-chain bridges</li>
      <li>Advanced staking logic</li>
      <li>Frictionless swaps</li>
      <li>Ever-more efficient consensus models</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But ask this: who benefits?</p>

    <p>More often than not, it's devs building tools for other devs to build tools for... more devs. We've created a closed loop of technical brilliance that too often loops back on itself.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, the basics are missing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Storefronts where you can actually buy things with crypto</li>
      <li>Labor markets that pay in crypto, not convert it back to fiat</li>
      <li>Point-of-sale systems small shops can use without a manual</li>
      <li>Wallets that your non-technical friends can understand</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Crypto hasn't failed. But it hasn't shipped the <strong>useful parts</strong>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Race to Be First vs. The Race to Be Useful</h2>
    <p>There's nothing wrong with innovation.</p>
    <p>But being first to build something no one needs is just expensive performance art.</p>

    <p>The real question isn't "can we build it?" It's:</p>
    <p><strong>"Will this be useful to more than 25 people?"</strong></p>

    <p>And even more importantly:</p>
    <p><strong>"Will this make crypto usable for someone who isn't a developer or investor?"</strong></p>

    <p>That's the bar. Not elegance. Not novelty. <strong>Usefulness.</strong></p>

    <div class="quote-large">
      "How can a normal person live their life using Kaspa without ever touching a bank?"
    </div>

    <div class="compass-section">
      <p>That's the compass.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Developer Trap</h2>
    <p>It's not malicious. It's just easy to fall into:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We build for the people we know (other devs)</li>
      <li>They build cool stuff on top (also for devs)</li>
      <li>Users don't show up because it's not for them</li>
      <li>Funding goes to things that look impressive, not things that help anyone</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And now the biggest measure of success is... a GitHub star? A retweet? A testnet?</p>

    <p>We're stuck in a feedback loop. And it's burning time.</p>

    <p>Escaping that loop takes <strong>courage</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To build boring but essential tools</li>
      <li>To stop chasing flash</li>
      <li>To serve people who <em>don't know what a DAG is and don't care</em></li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What A Real Crypto Economy Looks Like</h2>
    <p>Imagine this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You earn KAS from your job</li>
      <li>You spend it on groceries, rent, coffee</li>
      <li>The person receiving it doesn't ask you to convert to USD</li>
      <li>No one thinks about tokens, bridges, or block explorers</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It just works. Like email. Like tap-to-pay. Like real money.</p>

    <p>This isn't utopia. It's infrastructure. And we're nowhere near it.</p>

    <p>Because most of what's being built is <strong>not meant for that world</strong>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Build Differently</h2>
    <p>We're not here to impress each other. We're here to make crypto usable for people who don't go to crypto conferences.</p>

    <p>That means:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Building bridges to the real world, not just between blockchains</li>
      <li>Creating tools that solve daily problems, not just technical challenges</li>
      <li>Designing for someone who doesn't want to get rich, just wants to get paid</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The innovation is still there. But it's grounded. Focused. Human.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="final-section">
    <h2>The System Is Broken. But We Can Build Something Better.</h2>
    <p>We don't need another token. We need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Wallets with purpose</li>
      <li>Work paid in KAS</li>
      <li>Shops that accept KAS</li>
      <li>Dashboards that help people understand what's going on</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Crypto has enough engineers. What it needs now is <strong>plumbers</strong>. People willing to lay the pipes that connect it all.</p>

    <p>If that's you, welcome.</p>
    <p>You're not too late.</p>
    <p><strong>You're early.</strong></p>
