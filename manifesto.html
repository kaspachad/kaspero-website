  <div class="subtitle">Infrastructure Before Hype</div>
  <div class="subtitle" style="margin-top: -2rem;">A sober vision for a real crypto economy</div>

  <div class="header-image">

  </div>

  <div class="opening-section">
    <p>Crypto was supposed to change the world.</p>
    <p>It was supposed to replace money - not build <strong>bridges back to fiat</strong>.</p>
    <p>It was supposed to create a new economic layer - not become a <strong>casino</strong> where speculation masquerades as innovation.</p>
    <p class="highlight-text">We can still build that future. But we need to ask harder questions first.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>Look around the crypto space and you'll see incredible technical talent building impressive solutions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Elegant cross-chain protocols with cutting-edge cryptography</li>
      <li>Sophisticated DeFi mechanisms that would make traditional finance jealous</li>
      <li>Novel consensus algorithms that push the boundaries of distributed systems</li>
      <li>Smart contract platforms optimized for every conceivable use case</li>
    </ul>

    <p>But here's the uncomfortable question: <strong>Who are we building for?</strong></p>

    <p>Too often, the honest answer is "ourselves" - other developers, other protocols, other tokens. We've created an ecosystem where the most common users are builders, and the most common use case is building more infrastructure.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, the foundational pieces of a real crypto economy remain unbuilt:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Storefronts where people can actually buy things with crypto</li>
      <li>Labor marketplaces where work is paid in crypto, not converted to fiat</li>
      <li>Point-of-sale systems that small businesses can actually use</li>
      <li>Consumer experiences that don't require a computer science degree</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The race to be first vs. the race to be useful</h2>
    <p>There's nothing wrong with wanting to be first. Innovation requires risk-taking and bold moves. But being first at building something no one needs is just expensive performance art.</p>

    <p>The real question isn't "Can we build this?" It's "Should we build this?"</p>

    <blockquote>How can a normal person live their life using Kaspa without ever touching a bank?</blockquote>

    <p>That question should guide every technical decision. Not "What's the most elegant solution?" but "What gets us closer to that world?"</p>

    <p>We need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Commerce platforms before more DEX innovations</li>
      <li>User-friendly wallets before wallet-to-wallet protocols</li>
      <li>Real storefronts before more token standards</li>
      <li>Practical adoption tools before theoretical scaling solutions</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The developer trap we've all fallen into</h2>
    <p>We've created a feedback loop where:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Developers build for developers because that's the only audience that exists</li>
      <li>The only users are other developers because that's the only audience we're building for</li>
      <li>Funding goes to projects that impress other developers, not ones that serve real needs</li>
      <li>Success is measured by technical achievement, not real-world impact</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This isn't malicious. It's natural. But it's also a trap that keeps crypto from reaching its potential.</p>

    <p>Breaking out requires a different kind of courage - the courage to build boring, useful things instead of impressive, unused things.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>What would a real crypto economy look like?</h2>
    <p>Imagine if crypto worked like the internet:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your barista gets paid in KAS and uses it to buy groceries</li>
      <li>Small businesses accept crypto because it's easier than traditional payments</li>
      <li>People save and spend in crypto because it's more convenient than fiat</li>
      <li>The economic infrastructure just works, invisibly, in the background</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This isn't about ideology. It's about utility. Money should be a tool that makes life easier, not a puzzle that requires solving.</p>

    <p>The path there isn't through more financial primitives. It's through making crypto useful for the 99% of the population who don't care about financial primitives.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>A different kind of building</h2>
    <p>This doesn't mean abandoning innovation. It means directing our considerable talents toward problems that matter to people who aren't us.</p>

    <p>It means asking "What do regular people need?" before asking "What can the technology do?"</p>

    <p>It means building bridges to the real world, not just bridges between blockchains.</p>

    <p>The technical challenges are just as hard. The difference is that solving them actually changes lives.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="closing-statement">
    We're not here to build the most impressive technology.<br>We're here to build the most <em>useful</em> one.
